These are the pin assignments used in the node code. These appear to be specific to each hardware so if
you change the shield to a different chip/manufacturer etc they will have there own pin assignments.

// Pin mapping Dragino Shield
const lmic_pinmap lmic_pins = {
    .nss = 10,
    .rxtx = LMIC_UNUSED_PIN,
    .rst = 9,
    .dio = {2, 6, 7},
};
