The function shown below and not including the dotted line is configured in the TTN
Application Decoder Payload Format section. It basically takes the payload from the 
sensor node attached to the TTN Application and converts it to a ASCII string for
the carbon based interface to be able to read.

----------------

function Decoder(bytes, port) {

return {
    ASCII: String.fromCharCode.apply(null, bytes)
};

}
