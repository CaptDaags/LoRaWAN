Scripts and information relating to LoRaWAN. Gateway and also sensor nodes.

Generally this is for my use but feel free to look around and use what you can as long as you abide by fair play and the license. I will indicate in the code if I've pilfered it from somebody else.

If you blow shit up with what you find here then all the more fool ya are. I profess no expertise here so use at your own peril.

Current configuration that this covers:

Gateway: Raspberry Pi 3B+ with RHF shield on AU 915 frequency plan.
Node: Arduino Uno with Draguino Lora shield on AU 915 frequency plan.
